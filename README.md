Description:
The Auction Bidding Program is a simple Python script that allows multiple users to participate in an auction by submitting their bids. The program collects bids from users and then identifies the highest bidder at the end of the auction.

Features:
Collects bids from multiple users.
Keeps track of the highest bid and bidder.
Allows users to decide whether more participants will bid or not.
Declares the highest bidder and their bid when the auction ends.

How to Use:
Run the Python script.
You will be prompted to enter your name and the amount of your bid.
After each bid, you will be asked if there are any other bidders:
Type 'yes' to continue bidding.
Type 'no' when there are no more bidders.
When the auction ends, the program will display the highest bid and the winning bidder.
